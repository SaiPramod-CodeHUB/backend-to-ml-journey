# Backend to ML Journey 🚀

> Documenting my transition from Senior Java/Backend Engineer (Apple, 5+ years)
> to ML Engineering — bridging production distributed systems with Python ML.

## 🎯 Why This Journey

After 7+ years building enterprise microservices at Apple — Spring Boot, Kafka,
AWS, reactive systems — I'm now expanding into ML Engineering.

My edge: I don't just train models. I know how to **deploy them in production**
using the same Java/cloud infrastructure enterprises already run.

## 📚 Learning Roadmap

### ✅ Completed
- Python fundamentals
- LLM concepts (RAG, prompt engineering, agents)

### 🔄 In Progress
- Scikit-learn — classification, regression, model evaluation
- Pandas & NumPy — data manipulation and feature engineering
- Kaggle micro-courses — hands-on ML practice

### 📅 Upcoming
- FastAPI — ML model deployment as REST services
- TensorFlow — deep learning fundamentals
- AWS ML Specialty certification prep
- MLOps — model monitoring and drift detection

## 🛠️ Projects Being Built

| Project | Status | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| Customer Churn Prediction API | 🔄 In Progress | Python · Scikit-learn · FastAPI · Spring Boot |
| Real-Time Anomaly Detector | 📅 Planned | Kafka · Isolation Forest · Spring Boot |
| ML Model Monitor | 📅 Planned | Python · Spring Boot · PostgreSQL |

---

## 💡 My Approach

Unlike pure ML engineers, I focus on **production-ready ML integration**:

- Train model in Python (Scikit-learn / TensorFlow)
- Serve it via FastAPI inference endpoint  
- Expose through Spring Boot gateway (enterprise Java pattern)
- Deploy with Docker + CI/CD pipelines
- Monitor with drift detection

This mirrors how ML actually gets deployed in enterprise Java environments.

# Backend to Machine Learning Journey

## About Me
I am a Senior Backend Engineer with 7+ years of experience building and supporting production-grade systems using Java and related backend technologies.

Over the years, I’ve worked on scalable services, system reliability, issue resolution, and business-critical applications. I’m now expanding my skill set to include Python and Machine Learning to build smarter, data-driven systems.

## Why This Transition
Modern software systems increasingly rely on data-driven decision making.  
Rather than treating Machine Learning as a separate discipline, I see it as a natural extension of backend engineering.

My goal is to combine:
- Strong backend fundamentals
- Production thinking
- Machine Learning concepts

This transition is focused on **practical application**, not theory.

## What I’m Building
This repository documents my hands-on journey from backend engineering into Machine Learning.

Planned work includes:
- Learning and applying core Machine Learning concepts using Python
- Building end-to-end ML projects (data → model → evaluation)
- Writing clean, explainable, and production-oriented ML code
- Documenting decisions, trade-offs, and results clearly

The primary focus is on **real-world, business-relevant ML problems**, not academic exercises.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control and documentation

---

## Approach
- Consistent daily progress
- One project at a time
- Simple, correct, and explainable solutions
- Engineering-first mindset

---

## Status
🚧 In Progress — actively learning, building, and refining.

Updates will be added regularly as the work evolves.
